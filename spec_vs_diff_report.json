  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive multi-page website for City Pharma and Diagnostic Centre. Most requirements are substantially implemented, but several specific acceptance criteria are only partially or not met. Key issues include: use of TanStack Router instead of React Router v6 as specified; Framer Motion is not actually imported or used anywhere in the diff (animations are CSS-based instead); color tokens are namespaced under 'brand' rather than extending the top-level 'orange'/'maroon' keys; and page transition animations via Framer Motion are absent.",
